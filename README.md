# TCGA-BRCA Gene Expression Analysis

## Project Overview

This project explores RNA-seq gene expression patterns in breast cancer using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas Breast Invasive Carcinoma (TCGA-BRCA) project. The analysis focuses on ESR1 and PGR, two genes involved in hormone receptor signaling.

## Analysis

The project analyzes gene expression across 1,231 samples using descriptive statistics and five visualizations:

- Histogram of ESR1 expression
- Scatter plot comparing ESR1 and PGR expression
- Box plot of ESR1 expression across PAM50 subtypes
- Heatmap of the 10 genes with the highest average raw counts
- Density plot of ESR1 expression across PAM50 subtypes

## Tools

R, RStudio, tidyverse, ggplot2, ComplexHeatmap, circlize, R Markdown, and LaTeX.

## Data

Data were obtained from the TCGA-BRCA project through the National Cancer Institute's Genomic Data Commons: https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/

To run the R Markdown analysis, place `counts.csv` and `meta_data.csv` inside a folder named `data`.

## Project Files

- `GulzarArwa-FinalProject.Rmd` — R analysis code
- `TCGA_BRCA_Final_Report_Indent_Fixed.tex` — LaTeX report source
- `figures/` — Five visualization images

## Limitations

The analysis uses raw, unnormalized RNA-seq counts and is intended for descriptive exploration rather than statistical inference.
